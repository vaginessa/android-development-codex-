### Google Experience

These are Android devices that Google supported, designed, or otherwise used as reference devices. They tend to be the fastest to update and the most developer friendly.

* [[LG Optimus G E970]] (E970) - While it's not actually a Nexus device, it is based on the exact same hardware as the Google Nexus 4, and can actually be transformed into a Nexus 4. That makes this phone desirable as a Nexus 4 with an SDCard slot and LTE.

## Windows Mobile 6

XDA was originally named for the HTC Windows Mobile Phones, one line of which was known as the Xda. The modding community on this system made XDA the massive conglomerate it is today.

Unfortunately, the old forums that made XDA popular are beginning to fade away and collapse into link rot. Here, we attempt to salvage and liquidate the great work of XDA of the past, for the benefit of the future.

* [[HTC Herald]] (WING) - **Status:** Complete, ROMs undergoing liquidation
