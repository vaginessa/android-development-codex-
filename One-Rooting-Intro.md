* **If you're even thinking about rooting your device, do it ASAP.** Your One will be wiped in the process of rooting. And the catch-22 is that *you need to be rooted to back up app data!* It's easy to unroot devices; it's not so easy to root them when you've got a lot of important save data.

* If you have any issues or need to send it in for repair, **you can easily reverse the root and relock the device** at any time, and no one will be the wiser. But in the unlikely chance that things do go wrong, **we hold no responsibility for any damage or voided warranties.** OnePlus **will not void your warranty** if you unlock the bootloader, however you should still be careful.

* **Unlocking the bootloader *will* wipe all data.** Back up any important content on your phone, and move them somewhere safe. Contacts, emails, and bookmarks will be synced with your Google account. However, **some app data cannot be recovered easily**.

* After rooting, you can choose to stay with Google's stock Android for official updates, or install a custom ROM from XDA for more features. **If you wish to stay on stock Android, make sure you follow the proper set of instructions.** Of course, if you screw up at any time, just restore it back.
