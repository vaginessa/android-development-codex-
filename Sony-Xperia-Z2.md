## FTF Flashing for Rooted 4.4.2 Firmware Phones

My Sony Xperia Z2 was already rooted (but still has locked bootloader engaged). I wanted to update to Android 5.0.2, but it now requires a special update method to retain root privileges.

1. Install [XZDualRecovery](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2785598).
2. Find an FTF for your device on [this XDA Thread.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2759934)
3. [Modify the FTF](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-z2/general/4-4-4-creating-rooted-update-package-t2933155) to add root privileges, and prevent it from overwriting TA and PARTITION.
